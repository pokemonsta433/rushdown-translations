Hello! This is where you can translate our game in your very own language! We will of course be double-checking your work before it makes its way into the game, but for now translating (or reviewing!) these documents will ensure that your language gets into the game quickly, efficiently, and in some cases, at all. 

Please be respectful with this page, and submit pull requests for changes you would like to push to the available files. If you do not see your language here on the list, then feel free to create a new file and copy the en-US_UIBase file and begin translating it.


A string (line of text) follows this format:

\<string name="string.name">THE TEXT THAT THE USER WILL SEE\</string>


your job is to translate the text in between the <string> </string> tags. in this case the translated version might look like this:

\<string name="string.name">ユーザーに表示されるテキスト\</string>

note that only the text inside the tags has been translated.

Thank you for your help in this project,
